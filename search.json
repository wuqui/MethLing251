The fact that a word is listed in a dictionary at all is taken to prove that there is such a word. This can be misleading in two ways.\n\nFrom time to time, dictionaries list words erroneously, and the word has no existence outside the dictionary. The OED gives a list of such spurious words including banket (‘a term in bricklaying’), David’s staff (’a navigational instrument) and sardel, variously supposed to be a fish (the sardine) or a precious stone.\nDictionaries far more often fail to list perfectly good words.

    "text": "Evaluating research questions\nWe’ve explored the building blocks of strong research questions and hypotheses. Now, let’s practice applying this knowledge by critically evaluating some examples in detail.\n\nInstructions\nFor each research question presented below:\n\nCritique (2-3 minutes per RQ): Individually, analyse the research question. Drawing on the criteria we’ve discussed (like clarity, scope, operationalisability, and the characteristics of good RQs), consider and jot down:\n\nIts potential strengths\nIts potential weaknesses or areas needing clarification/refinement\nYour initial suggestions for improvement\n\nDiscuss & Compare: Share your critique with the class\n\n\n\n1. How does age influence the accommodation process?\n\nnarrow down age range (e.g., specific developmental stages like adolescence, early adulthood, or old age)\nconsider if “age” or “generation” is more appropriate\nspecify the time period (e.g., present-day, historical)\ndefine the place/society (e.g., specific city, cultural context)\nclarify “influence”: positive, negative, or specific types of influence?\nmake “How…?” more specific: in which particular ways does it influence?\nspecify aspects of “accommodation” (e.g., phonetic, lexical, syntactic, pragmatic)\n\n\n\n2. Age and gender influence language use\n\nthis is a statement, not a question. It needs to be rephrased into an interrogative form\n“language use” is too broad; specify which aspects of language use (e.g., vocabulary choice, politeness strategies, turn-taking)\n“influence”: similar to the above, how does it influence?\nconsider focusing on either age or gender, or clearly define how their interaction will be studied\n\n\n\n3. How do teenagers differ from adults in their use of swear words?\n\n“adults”: narrow down the age range for comparison (e.g., young adults, middle-aged adults)\n“how”: specify the nature of the difference (e.g., frequency, type of swear words, contexts of use)\n“use”: clarify usage contexts (e.g., informal peer talk, social media, formal settings)\nprovide a clear definition of “swear words” for the study\nspecify time period and place/society"

Its linguistics section includes a range of resources from academic journals, books, and primary sources.\nProQuest: ProQuest is a multidisciplinary research database, providing a variety of resources, including magazines, journals, newspapers, and more. It contains a wide range of materials in the field of linguistics.\nScienceDirect: ScienceDirect, from Elsevier, provides full text access to over 2,500 journals and 11,000 books.

    "text": "Corpus linguistics is a research methodology that systematically studies language using large collections of authentic texts, known as corpora. These collections, which can be either written or spoken, provide a comprehensive and empirical basis for analysing:\n\nlanguage use (e.g. collocational patterns such as pretty woman)\nlinguistic variation across different text types or communities (e.g. neologisms such as smash)\nlanguage change (e.g. going to future)\n\nThe primary goal is to investigate linguistic phenomena by examining real-world language usage. This approach contrasts with traditional linguistic methods that rely heavily on introspection and theoretical speculation, such as Chomsky’s poverty of the stimulus argument.\nRecent advances in data availability (e.g., web and social media corpora from Twitter and Reddit) and methods (e.g., social network analysis, machine learning) have given corpus linguistics significant momentum.\n“The term corpus linguistics refers to a methodology rather than a theory of language. The methodology consists in the empirical investigation of a specific set of research questions on the basis of authentic language data drawn from a corpus […]” (Stefanowitsch 2020, 22)\n“A corpus-based analysis is always a quantitative analysis at its core, even where it is supplemented by qualitative methods. The analysis is based on the frequencies of linguistic phenomena in the corpus and their distribution across the texts or text categories that make up the corpus. This means that a corpus-based analysis is always a statistical analysis.” (Stefanowitsch 2020, 55)\nStefanowitsch (2020) offers a phased definition of corpus linguistics:\n\n“Corpus linguistics is the investigation of linguistic phenomena on the basis of linguistic corpora.” (p. 46)\n“Corpus linguistics is the complete and systematic investigation of linguistic phenomena on the basis of linguistic corpora.” (p. 49)\n“Corpus linguistics is the complete and systematic investigation of linguistic phenomena on the basis of linguistic corpora using concordances, collocations, and frequency lists.” (p. 54)"

Thus, for a corpus (a sample of language use) to be representative of a particular language, the distribution of linguistic phenomena (words, grammatical structures, etc.) would have to be identical to their distribution in the language as a whole (or in the variety under investigation, see further below).” (Stefanowitsch 2020, 28)\nA language variety is any form of language that can be delineated from others based on cultural, linguistic, or demographic criteria. It serves as a superordinate term for:\n\ngenre: culturally defined and recognised varieties.\nregister: varieties characterised by a particular “functional configuration” (a bundle of linguistic features for a specific social function).\nstyle: degrees of formality (e.g. formal, informal, colloquial).\nmedium: material manifestation (e.g. spoken, written).\ntopic: the content of texts or the discourse domain.\ntext category: a specific variety included in a corpus.\n\n(Stefanowitsch 2020, 29)"

[…] For most linguistic phenomena that researchers are likely to want to investigate, these corpus sizes seem sufficient. Let us take this broad range as characterizing a linguistic corpus for practical purposes.” (Stefanowitsch 2020, 38)"
