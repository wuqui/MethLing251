# Term paper: Research Proposal

In this Methods course you will prepare a concise **Research Proposal** (≈3–5 pages) outlining an empirical study in linguistics and demonstrating your understanding of research design and methodology. It will serve as the plan for your future term paper or thesis.

## Contents of your research proposal

- **title** of your research project
    - a concise, descriptive title that captures your study focus
- **abstract**: how you expect the project to turn out
    - ~150–250 words summarising aims, methods and anticipated outcomes
- **research questions and hypotheses**
    - list one or more clear research questions and any testable hypotheses and why these hypotheses are plausible
    - this should be in structured full sentences, not just a list of keywords
- **data**: describe the data you intend to collect
    - specify type (e.g. corpus, questionnaire), source, size and language(s)
    - be specific and detailed: e.g. which sample of words/constructions are you studying? which parts of the corpus are you using?
- **methods**: explain the methods you will employ
    - outline analytical techniques (e.g. frequency analysis, collocation analysis), qualitative coding and tools
- **provisional table of contents**
    - propose major sections and subsections (e.g. introduction, literature review, methods)
- **working bibliography**
    - include references in Chicago author-date style

## Format

- ≈ 3–5 pages (2500–5000 characters)
- check your Studien-/Prüfungsordnung for exact details

# Dictionary vs lexicon

- "The lexicon is what linguists call the dictionary that is assumed to be **in people's heads**, or the linguist's best approximation to that.
- That is, it is fundamentally a *psychological entity*, and correspondingly, its contents cannot be observed directly, but must be deduced from speakers' and hearers' **behaviour**.

- There are two fundamental approaches to the lexicon.
    - The first is that, in the slogan, the lexicon is **the home of the lawless** (Di Sciullo and Williams 1987): that is, the lexicon contains whatever cannot be predicted by general rule.
    - The second, wider, approach sees the lexicon as not only containing the lawless, but also **containing anything to do with the structure of words**, whether it is lawless or not."

# The Lexicon

## Two senses of *lexicon*

"In the following, I will use lexicon in two senses that are not always sharply distinguished:

a) for a **metalinguistic level**, or a subcomponent in a linguistic model (basically compatible with a variety of theories of language); and
b) in the **sense of vocabulary** as seen from a systematic, synchronic point of view."

(Lipka, 1992, p. 11)

# What are dictionaries? [@Bauer2022Introduction]

## What is a Word?

- "A word is listed in the dictionary." (p. 2)
- But:
    - circular reasoning: words are listed *because* they are words
    - dictionaries also list smaller units (e.g. prefix like *un-*)

- "[...] in general we will accept the spelling conventions of English as defining words. This might not be terribly scientific, but it has the advantage of being practical." (p. 3)

## Defining *dictionary*

- "The term 'dictionary' is usually restricted to real-world dictionaries that appear in print and online.
- Dictionaries provide a list of words of whatever language they deal with — in our case, English — and then give a certain amount of information about each of them.
- Dictionaries tend to have two functions, which may, on occasions, conflict with each other:
    - to describe the language as it is, (descriptive)
    - and to provide an influence for establishing and maintaining the standard form of the language." (prescriptive)

## Proof of the Existence of Words

"First of all, dictionaries provide evidence of the existence of a word. The fact that a word is listed in a dictionary at all is taken to prove that there is such a word. This can be misleading in two ways.

- From time to time, dictionaries **list words erroneously**, and the word has no existence outside the dictionary. The OED gives a list of such spurious words including *banket* ('a term in bricklaying'), *David's staff* ('a navigational instrument) and *sardel*, variously supposed to be a fish (the sardine) or a precious stone.
- Dictionaries far more often **fail to list perfectly good words**. This is inevitable. No dictionary can list every word of English"

## Objective of Lexicology

- "What is most important, however, is that in lexicology the stock of words or lexical items is not simply regarded as a **list of isolated elements**.
- Lexicologists try to find out **generalizations** and **regularities** and especially consider **relations** between elements.
- Lexicology is therefore concerned with **structures**, not with a mere agglomeration of words (cf. Jackson 1988: 222)."

[@Lipka2002EnglishLexicology, p. 1]

# Types of Dictionaries

## General Purpose Dictionaries

- Provide **comprehensive** linguistic information about words in a single language
    - Spelling, pronunciation, and grammatical classification
    - Multiple meanings and contextual usage examples
    - Etymology and historical development notes
- Typically **monolingual** and organised alphabetically for easy reference
- Valuable for **morphological research** because they:
    - Document detailed word origins and development
    - Show common usage patterns and variations
    - Provide historical context for word formation

## Bilingual and Multilingual Dictionaries

# Practice: Investigating Lexical Innovation Since 2000 Using the OED

## Use the Advanced Search to Find All Lexemes Whose First Use is After 2000

![OED Advanced Search interface](att/image_1700133799936_0.png){width="600"}

→ export the results to a `csv` file.

## Analyse the exported file in Microsoft Excel

### Questions

1. Which word-formation processes are most frequent?
2. Which word classes are most frequent?
3. Which subject areas are most frequent?

### Steps

- Save the file in Excel's format with the `xlsx` extension.
- Create a `Table` containing the data.
    - Select the region containing the data.
    - Click on `Insert Table`.
- Create a `Pivot Table` to analyse the data.
