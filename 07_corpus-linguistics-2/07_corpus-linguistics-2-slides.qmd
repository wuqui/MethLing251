# Searching Corpora with CQL

Queries are run from the `Concordance` view using the **Corpus Query Language (CQL)**.

- **Tokens** are enclosed in square brackets: `[attribute="value"]`.
- **Example**: `[lemma="walk"]` finds *walk*, *walks*, *walked*, *walking*.

## Common Attributes

- `word`: exact word form
- `lemma`: dictionary form
- `tag`: part-of-speech tag (word class)

___

## Operators and Wildcards

- `[]`: any single token.
- `|`: OR operator (e.g., `[lemma="dog|cat"]`).
- `&`: AND operator (e.g., `[word="test" & tag="N.*"]`).
- `.` (dot): any single character.
- `+`: one or more occurrences.
- `*`: zero or more occurrences.
- `.*`: any sequence of characters (e.g., `[word="pre.*"]` matches *prefix*, *prepare*).

## Example Query

`[lemma="go"][word="to"][tag="N.*"]` finds *go to school*, *went to London*, *going to university*.

# Practice

## Searching Corpora

In the **BNC 2014 Spoken**, find all instances of:

1.  The word *run*.
2.  The noun *run*.
3.  The verb *RUN*.
4.  All verbs ending in *-ize* (e.g., *realize*, *maximize*).
5.  The noun *RUN* preceded by an adjective.
6.  Question tags (e.g., *isn't it?*, *are you?*).
7.  The construction *been V-ing* (e.g., *he been eating*).

___

| Task | CQL |
|------|-----|
| 1. the word *run* | `[word="run"]` |
| 2. the noun *run* | `[word="run" & tag="N.*"]` |
| 3. the verb *RUN* | `[lemma="run" & tag="V.*"]` |
| 4. all verbs ending in *-ize* (e.g., *realize*, *maximize*) | `[lemma=".*ize" & tag="V.*"]` |
| 5. the noun *RUN* preceded by an adjective | `[tag="J.*"] [lemma="run" & tag="N.*"]` |
| 6. question tags (e.g., *isn't it?*, *are you?*) | `[lemma="be|do|have"] [word="n't"]?  [tag="PP.?"] [word="\?"]` |
| 7. the construction *been V-ing* (e.g., *he been eating*) | `[lemma!="have"] [lemma!="have|not"] [word="been"] [tag="V.*" & word=".*ing"]  within <u/>` |
___

## Analysing Data

In the **BNC 2014 Spoken**:

1.  How frequent are *going to* vs. *gonna* as in *I'm [gonna | going to] go*?
2.  What are the most frequent verbs that complement *gonna*?
3.  Which age group uses *gonna* the most? (Use the `Agerange` text type variable).
4.  Compare the meaning and function of *gay* over time using Word Sketches in the EEBO and English Trends corpora.

# Theory

## Principles of building corpora (Knight, 2022)

:::{.smaller}
1.  The contents of a corpus should be selected without regard to the language they contain, but according to their **communicative function** in the community in which they arise.
2.  Corpus builders should strive to make their corpus as **representative** as possible of the language from which it is chosen.
3.  Only those components of corpora which have been designed to be **independently contrastive** should be contrasted.
4.  Criteria for determining the structure of a corpus should be small in number, clearly separate from each other and efficient as a group in **delineating a corpus** that is representative of the language or variety under examination.
5.  Any information about a text other than the alphanumeric string of its words and punctuation should be stored separately from the **plain text** and merged when required in applications.
6.  Samples of language for a corpus should, wherever possible, consist of **entire documents** or transcriptions of complete speech events, or should get as close to this target as possible. This means that samples will differ substantially in size.
7.  The design and composition of a corpus should be **documented** fully with information about the contents and arguments in justification of the decisions taken.
8.  The corpus builder should retain as target notions **representativeness and balance**. While these are not precisely definable and attainable goals, they must be used to guide the design of a corpus and the selection of its components.
9.  Any control of subject matter in a corpus should be imposed by the use of **external**, not internal, **criteria**.
10. A corpus should aim for **homogeneity** in its components while maintaining adequate **coverage**, and rogue texts should be avoided.

## Creating specialised corpora (Koester, 2022)

A specialised corpus is often defined by:

- **Specific purpose** for compilation, e.g. to investigate a particular grammatical or lexical item;
- **Contextualisation**: particular setting, participants and communicative purpose;
- **Genre**, e.g. promotional (grant proposals, sales letters);
- Type of **text/discourse**, e.g. biology textbooks, casual conversation;
- **Subject matter/topic**, e.g. economics;
- **Variety** of English, e.g. Learner English.

### Sharing corpora

- This example corpus is shared with all LMU users.
- You should find it under its name `qw-corpling-gutenberg`.
- You should be able to add files and edit metadata.

___

## From the web

For detailed instructions, see the [*Sketch Engine* documentation](https://www.sketchengine.eu/guide/create-a-corpus-from-the-web/).

### Web scraping settings

:::{.small}
- "As a rule of thumb, do not worry about the advanced settings and use the default settings. Only if the results do not produce the desired results, start looking into the advanced settings."
- "Please note that you can use multiwords such as `"kick the bucket"` using the quotes, and also proper names of different kinds."
- **Denylist**: "Denylist keywords can also be used to reduce ambiguity (e.g. you might use "politics" when collecting a corpus on the environment using "party"). It is only necessary to use the denylist and allowlist if you irrelevant documents are found, otherwise it is not necessary."
- **Searching for specific varieties**: "Limit the search to only UK domains or the domains of Portugal. Type .uk (.pt) into the site list in the advanced options."
- **Making your corpus bigger**: "You can repeat the same procedure several times to enlarge the corpus. Sketch Engine will make sure no page is included twice."
