How does age influence the accommodation process?\n\nnarrow down age range (e.g., specific developmental stages like adolescence, early adulthood, or old age)\nconsider if “age” or “generation” is more appropriate\nspecify the time period (e.g., present-day, historical)\ndefine the place/society (e.g., specific city, cultural context)\nclarify “influence”: positive, negative, or specific types of influence?\nmake “How…?” more specific: in which particular ways does it influence?\nspecify aspects of “accommodation” (e.g., phonetic, lexical, syntactic, pragmatic)\n\n\n\n2. Age and gender influence language use\n\nthis is a statement, not a question. It needs to be rephrased into an interrogative form\n“language use” is too broad; specify which aspects of language use (e.g., vocabulary choice, politeness strategies, turn-taking)\n“influence”: similar to the above, how does it influence?\nconsider focusing on either age or gender, or clearly define how their interaction will be studied\n\n\n\n3. How do teenagers differ from adults in their use of swear words?\n\n“adults”: narrow down the age range for comparison (e.g., young adults, middle-aged adults)\n“how”: specify the nature of the difference (e.g., frequency, type of swear words, contexts of use)\n“use”: clarify usage contexts (e.g., informal peer talk, social media, formal settings)\nprovide a clear definition of “swear words” for the study\nspecify time period and place/society"
