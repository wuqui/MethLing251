# Research questions

## What is a research question?

- A research question (RQ) is the "compass" of your study
- It determines your aims and guides your choices of:
    - empirical data
    - theoretical concepts
    - literature
- It should be suitable for:
    - operationalisation with empirical data, or
    - challenging theoretical positions

## Types of research questions

### By function

- **descriptive**: aim to accurately and systematically describe a phenomenon
    - *example*: "What patterns of code-switching occur among bilingual teenagers in Munich?"
- **explanatory**: seek to clarify reasons behind a phenomenon
    - *example*: "Why do bilingual teenagers switch codes more frequently in peer-group settings?"
- **evaluative**: assess effectiveness or value of language components
    - *example*: "How effective is the new language policy in promoting multilingualism?"
- **causal-comparative**: explore cause-and-effect relationships
    - *example*: "How does age influence the accommodation process?"
- **correlational**: examine relationships between variables
    - *example*: "To what extent does language exposure correlate with proficiency?"

### By relation to project

- **primary vs secondary**
    - primary: drive core aim of project
    - secondary: provide additional details
- **main vs contributory**
    - main: central to research purpose
    - contributory: explore additional facets
- **overarching vs subordinate**
    - overarching: set broad framework
    - subordinate: address specific elements
- **empirical vs methodological vs theoretical**
    - empirical: test hypotheses
    - methodological: focus on techniques
    - theoretical: explore underlying theories
- **researcher-generated vs participant-generated**
    - researcher-generated: based on scholarly expertise
    - participant-generated: arise from participant interests
- **empirical vs speculative**
    - empirical: based on observable evidence
    - speculative: explore hypothetical scenarios (introspection)

## Formulating research questions

- **wording**
    - define every content word precisely
    - ensure understandability
    - use interrogative form
- **number**
    - start with many, narrow down
    - ensure manageability
- **sequence**
    - consider logical order
    - build on previous questions

# Hypotheses

## What is a hypothesis?

- A prerequisite for drawing conclusions
- An assumed answer to a question
- A generally valid claim
- An assumption about real phenomena
- A prediction of findings

## Characteristics

- More precise than research questions
- Statement to be confirmed or refuted
- About potential relations between variables
- Must be falsifiable
- Can be operationalised

## The null hypothesis

- Special case in negative form
- States that observed differences occur by chance
- No correlation between variables
- Research aims to reject (or accept) it

# Practice: RQ or Hypothesis? Sharpening the Focus

Let's practice distinguishing between research questions, hypotheses, and general statements/topics, and to consider how they can be refined.

## Instructions

1. You will be divided into small breakout rooms for about 7-10 minutes
2. In your groups, discuss each of the statements below
3. For each statement, decide:
    - Is it a Research Question (RQ)? If so, what type might it be (descriptive, explanatory, etc.)?
    - Is it a Hypothesis (H)? If so, what might be a corresponding RQ? Can you think of a null hypothesis?
    - Is it Neither (e.g., a general topic or an aim)? If so, how could it be sharpened into a good RQ or a testable H?
4. Be prepared to share your group's thoughts when we reconvene

## Statements for Discussion

1. The language of online gaming
2. Investigating whether younger learners acquire new vocabulary faster than older learners
3. Children who read more books will have larger vocabularies
4. How do bilingual children develop code-switching skills between the ages of 3 and 5?
5. Using phonics instruction improves reading scores in first-grade students

# Important criteria

## Variables

- "Feature of a particular case, and a particular case can take one of a set of possible features" [@Rasinger2010QuantitativeMethods, 53]
- *example*: gender as variable with two (or more) values
- **independent vs dependent**
    - independent: manipulated or controlled
    - dependent: measured or observed

## Operationalisation

- Translating properties into numerical values
- Essential for quantitative methods
- *example*: measuring politeness through:
    - formal pronoun usage (*Sie* vs *du*)
    - politeness markers per utterance

## Reliability and validity

- **reliability**
    - study must be replicable
    - results must be consistent
- **validity**
    - method must be appropriate
    - must measure what it claims to measure
    - **internal**: results not skewed by non-intended factors
    - **external**: generalisation to larger populations

# Practice: evaluating and developing RQ

Now, let's apply these concepts to some practical examples and begin developing your own research ideas.

## Evaluating research questions

We've explored the building blocks of strong research questions and hypotheses. Now, let's practice applying this knowledge by critically evaluating some examples in detail.

### Instructions

For each research question presented below:

1. **Critique (2-3 minutes per RQ)**: Individually, analyse the research question. Drawing on the criteria we've discussed (like clarity, scope, operationalisability, and the characteristics of good RQs), consider and jot down:
    - Its potential strengths
    - Its potential weaknesses or areas needing clarification/refinement
    - Your initial suggestions for improvement

2. **Discuss & Compare**: Share your critique with the class

### 1. How does age influence the accommodation process?

- narrow down age range (e.g., specific developmental stages like adolescence, early adulthood, or old age)
- consider if "age" or "generation" is more appropriate
- specify the time period (e.g., present-day, historical)
- define the place/society (e.g., specific city, cultural context)
- clarify "influence": positive, negative, or specific types of influence?
- make "How…?" more specific: in which particular ways does it influence?
- specify aspects of "accommodation" (e.g., phonetic, lexical, syntactic, pragmatic)

### 2. Age and gender influence language use

- this is a statement, not a question. It needs to be rephrased into an interrogative form
- "language use" is too broad; specify which aspects of language use (e.g., vocabulary choice, politeness strategies, turn-taking)
- "influence": similar to the above, how does it influence?
- consider focusing on either age *or* gender, or clearly define how their interaction will be studied

### 3. How do teenagers differ from adults in their use of swear words?

- "adults": narrow down the age range for comparison (e.g., young adults, middle-aged adults)
- "how": specify the nature of the difference (e.g., frequency, type of swear words, contexts of use)
- "use": clarify usage contexts (e.g., informal peer talk, social media, formal settings)
- provide a clear definition of "swear words" for the study
- specify time period and place/society

## Finding your own research questions

1. Choose a topic
    - broad enough to be interesting
    - narrow enough to be doable
    - strong linguistic focus
2. Formulate research questions
    - check scope and focus
    - ensure manageability
3. Develop hypotheses
    - based on expectations
    - supported by literature
4. Review previous work
    - identify gaps
    - determine contribution
5. Plan data and methods
    - suitable data sources
    - appropriate methods

# Key takeaways

- Well-formulated **research questions (RQs)** are the compass of any empirical study, guiding data collection, methodology, and analysis
- **Hypotheses** are specific, testable predictions derived from RQs, particularly prominent in quantitative research
- RQs can be **descriptive** (what), **explanatory** (why/how), **evaluative**, **causal-comparative**, or **correlational**, each suggesting different approaches
- Key criteria for good RQs and hypotheses include:
    - **Clarity and precision**: all terms must be clearly defined
    - **Operationalisability**: concepts must be translatable into measurable variables
    - **Falsifiability**: hypotheses must be refutable
    - **Manageability**: the scope should be feasible within given constraints
- **Variables** (independent and dependent) are central to operationalisation
- **Reliability** (consistency of results) and **validity** (measuring what is intended) are crucial for the credibility of your research
- Developing RQs and hypotheses is often an iterative process, refined as you engage with literature and data
