# Course Overview

::: {.notes}
12:15–12:20 (5 minutes)
Welcome back for our final session. Today we'll consolidate what we've learned and look at concrete applications.
:::


## Our Journey Through Research Methods

From topic identification to data analysis:

- **Foundation** (Sessions 1-4): Organization, note-taking, research questions, references
- **Data Sources** (Sessions 5-7): Dictionaries, corpus linguistics theory & practice, corpus search
- **Data Collection** (Sessions 8-9): Questionnaires, interviews, reading strategies
- **Output & Analysis** (Sessions 10-11): Academic writing, data analysis
- **Integration** (Today): Bringing it all together
- **Final Project**: Your own research project


## Key Learning Objectives

- Plan and organize research work effectively
- Develop focused research questions and hypotheses
- Find, manage and synthesize literature
- Collect data using various methods (corpora, surveys)
- Analyze data with appropriate statistical tools
- Write and present research findings academically


# The Research Process: Integrated View

::: {.notes}
12:20–12:35 (15 minutes)
Let's see how all our topics connect in a complete research workflow.
:::

## From Idea to Publication

- Topic Identification
- Research Questions and Hypotheses
- Literature Review
- Method Selection
- Data Collection
- Data Analysis
- Writing & Reporting
- Peer Review & Publication


## Example: Complete Research Project

**Research Question**: "How has the use of modal verbs changed in academic writing over the past 20 years?"

1. **Planning** (Session 2): Gantt chart, SMART goals
2. **Research Question** (Session 3): Operationalizable, testable hypothesis
3. **Literature** (Session 4): Zotero for reference management
4. **Data Source** (Sessions 6-7): COCA corpus, time-series analysis
5. **Analysis** (Session 11): Statistical trends, Excel visualization
6. **Writing** (Session 10): Clear structure, academic style



# Methodological Synthesis

::: {.notes}
12:35–12:50 (15 minutes)
Now let's discuss how different methods complement each other.
:::

## Mixed Methods Approach

**Quantitative + Qualitative = Richer Insights**

| Method | Strengths | Best Used For |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| **Corpus Analysis** | Large datasets, patterns | Language change, frequency trends |
| **Surveys** | Standardized responses | Attitudes, self-reported behavior |
| **Interviews** | Detailed insights | Motivations, complex phenomena |
| **Experiments** | Controlled variables | Causal relationships |

## Triangulation Example

**Research Question**: "Why do young Germans use English loanwords?"

- **Corpus**: Frequency of English loanwords (Sessions 6-7)
- **Survey**: Attitudes toward English borrowing (Session 8)  
- **Interviews**: Personal motivations and contexts (Session 8)
- **Analysis**: Integration of quantitative/qualitative findings (Session 11)

## Tool Integration Workflow

1. **Obsidian/Logseq**: Networked note-taking throughout
2. **Zotero**: Literature management and citation
3. **Dictionaries**: e.g. OED for creating a sample of target words
3. **Corpus tools**: Sketch Engine and english-corpora.org for data collection
4. **Excel**: Statistical analysis and visualization  
5. **Word/LaTeX**: Final writing and formatting



# Practical Applications

::: {.notes}
12:50–13:05 (15 minutes)
Break: 12:57–13:02
Let's see these methods in action with concrete examples.
:::

## Case Study 1: Corpus-Based Analysis

**Project**: Tracking semantic change of *woke* 

**Tools and data sources**:

- COCA time-series data (2000-2020)
- Excel pivot tables for frequency analysis
- Collocation analysis and Word Sketches in Sketch Engine

**Key Findings**:

- 2010-2015: Primarily African American vernacular
- 2016-2020: Mainstream political discourse
- Semantic broadening + evaluative shift

## Case Study 2: Survey + Interview Study

**Project**: Multilingual identity in Munich

**Design**:

- Online questionnaire (n=200): Language use patterns
- Semi-structured interviews (n=20): Identity narratives  
- Mixed-methods analysis: statistical + thematic

**Tools**: Google Forms, Excel analysis & qualitative coding


# Writing and Communication

::: {.notes}
13:05–13:20 (15 minutes)
Academic writing as the culmination of your research process.
:::

## Structure Recap: Empirical Papers

1. **Introduction**: Research gap & research questions and hypotheses
2. **Literature Review**: Theoretical background + previous findings  
3. **Methodology**: Data sources + analytical procedures
4. **Results**: Findings with evidence (tables, figures)
5. **Discussion**: Interpretation, implications, limitations, future work
6. **Conclusion**: Summary, broader implications

## Key Writing Principles

- **Clarity over elegance**: Simple, precise language (e.g. verbs > nouns, active > passive voice)
- **Evidence-based claims**: Every statement supported
- **Logical flow**: Coherent argument structure
- **Reproducible methods**: Detailed procedure descriptions

## Tools for Academic Writing

- **Planning**: Mind maps, outlines (Session 10), time management
- **Writing**: Word with citation management (e.g. Zotero)
- **Revision**: Peer feedback, iterative process
- **Style**: Academic conventions, stylesheet



# Data Analysis: Best Practices

::: {.notes}
13:20–13:35 (15 minutes)
Consolidating our statistical and analytical knowledge.
:::

## Data setup

![Statistical thinking framework](att/descriptive-vs-inferential.png){width="500"}

**Tidy Data Principles** [@Wickham2014Tidy]:

- **Each observation forms a row**: Every single data point in a different row
- **Each variable forms a column**: Clear visibility and easy manipulation  
- **Column names should be descriptive**: Clear, informative headers
- **Store metadata separately**: Data collection process, coding guides
- **Favour long format over wide**: More rows, fewer columns
- **Keep raw data separate**: Use new tabs for analyses


## Visualization Principles

![Data analysis accuracy](att/confusion-matrix.png){width="400"}

**Good Visualizations**:

- Clear axis labels and titles
- Appropriate chart types for data
- Accessible color schemes
- Integrated into text discussion

**Avoid**: 3D charts, excessive decoration, misleading scales
