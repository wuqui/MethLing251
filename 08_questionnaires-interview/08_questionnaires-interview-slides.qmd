Today we'll explore two key data collection methods in linguistic research:

- **Questionnaires**: Structured data collection tools
- **Interviews**: In-depth conversation-based research

Both methods allow us to gather insights about language use, attitudes, and behaviour.

___

# Questionnaires

::: {.notes}
12:17–12:42
:::

## What is a questionnaire?

A questionnaire is a structured data collection instrument consisting of:

- **Instructions** for participants
- **Questions or statements** 
- **Possible answers** or response options

Used widely in sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, and applied linguistics research.

___

**Examples:**

::: {.notes}
12:20–12:22
:::

- **Sociolinguistics**: The Language Experience and Proficiency Questionnaire (LEAP-Q) for bilingual speakers, language attitude questionnaires investigating speaker evaluations
- **Psycholinguistics**: Language background questionnaires in bilingual processing studies, self-assessment scales for language dominance and proficiency
- **Applied linguistics**: L2 motivation questionnaires, willingness to communicate scales, language anxiety measures

___

## Question Types

::: {.notes}
12:22–12:24
:::

:::: {.columns}
::::: {.column width="50%"}
### Open Questions

Allow participants to respond freely in their own words.

**Example**: *"How do you feel about using dialect in formal settings?"*
:::::

::::: {.column width="50%"}
### Closed Questions

Provide standardised response options.

Used in standardised surveys for quantitative analysis.

**Example**: "How would you rate your English speaking proficiency?

- [ ] 1 – Beginner
- [ ] 2 – Elementary
- [ ] 3 – Intermediate
- [ ] 4 – Advanced
- [ ] 5 – Native-like

    - British English, American English, Australian English
    - Male, female, non-binary
- **Ordinal scale**: Ranked order  
    - Beginner, intermediate, advanced, native-like proficiency
    - Strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree
- **Interval scale**: Equal intervals between values
    - Temperature in Celsius, standardised test scores
    - Likert scale ratings (1-7)
- **Ratio scale**: True zero point
    - Age in years, number of languages spoken
    - Words per minute, percentage of dialect use

___

# Research Design Considerations

::: {.notes}
12:33–12:34 (Section: 12:33–12:42)
:::

## Micro vs. Macro Approaches

### Microlinguistics

- Focus on **individual speakers**
- **Language structure**: phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics
- Detailed analysis of linguistic forms and usage

**Example**: Investigating how individual speakers produce word-final consonants in different phonetic environments

### Macrolinguistics  

- Focus on **language in society**
- Includes sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics
- Language policy and planning

**Example**: Examining how language attitudes towards regional dialects vary across different social groups in a community

___

::: {.small}

## Study Types

::: {.notes}
12:34–12:36
:::

### 1. Cross-sectional Studies

- Data collected at **one point in time**
- Snapshot of current language use/attitudes

**Example**: Surveying university students' attitudes towards English as a medium of instruction in 2024

### 2. Longitudinal Studies  

- **Same participants** followed over time
- Track language change and development

**Example**: Following the same group of immigrant children for 5 years to track their L2 acquisition progress

### 3. Pseudo-longitudinal Studies

- **Different samples** at different time points
- Less expensive but different participants

**Example**: Comparing language attitudes of 20-year-olds in 1990 vs. 20-year-olds in 2020 to infer generational change

:::

___

## Analytical Approaches

::: {.notes}
12:36–12:39
:::

- **Quantitative approach** [@Labov1972Sociolinguistic]: Large-scale surveys, statistical analysis
    - *Example*: @Trudgill1974Norwich Norwich study correlating *-ing* vs *-in* with social class
- **Social networks approach** [@Milroy1987Networks]: Focus on community ties and network density
    - *Example*: Belfast study showing tight-knit communities preserve vernacular features (e.g. deletion of /θ/ in words like *mother*)
- **Qualitative approach**: In-depth interviews, ethnographic observation
    - *Example*: Life history interviews about language shift in immigrant families
- **Mixed methods** [@Creswell2014Research]: Combine quantitative and qualitative for comprehensive view
    - *Example*: Survey + focus groups on language policy attitudes

::: {.notes}
**Labov**: **Quantitative methods** revolutionised sociolinguistics. **Apparent-time hypothesis** studies language change through age variation.

**Milroy**: **Dense networks** maintain vernacular forms; **loose networks** facilitate change.

**Mixed methods**: Popular for **triangulation** - *breadth* (quantitative) + *depth* (qualitative).

___

# Practice: Questionnaire Design

::: {.notes}
12:42–12:52
:::

**Pair work:**

Design 5 questions to investigate language attitudes in multilingual contexts.

*Language attitudes = beliefs, feelings, and evaluations people have about different languages or language varieties (e.g., prestige, correctness, usefulness).*

Include:

- 1 open question
- 2 different types of closed questions  
- 1 demographic question
- Consider your target population

**Group discussion**: Share and discuss your questions.
