# Research questions [@Litosseliti2025Methods]

## Discussion

### 1. Why can well-formulated research questions be seen as the "compass" of a study?

- They pinpoint exactly what you need to discover, guiding your choice of data sources and analytical tools
- A vague question leads to unfocused data collection and mismatched methods, risking inconclusive or irrelevant results

### 2. Pick a linguistic phenomenon (e.g. code-switching). How would you turn that into a descriptive vs. an explanatory research question?

- **Phenomenon:** Code-switching
  - **Descriptive:** "What patterns of code-switching occur among bilingual teenagers in Munich?"
    - Method: Corpus analysis of recorded conversations
  - **Explanatory:** "Why do bilingual teenagers switch codes more frequently in peer-group settings than in family interactions?"
    - Method: Mixed design—interviews to probe motivations plus quantitative counts

### 3. What does "operationalizability" mean in the context of research questions, and why is it crucial?

- **Meaning:** Defining each concept in measurable, observable terms so data and methods map directly onto your questions
- **Importance:** Ensures clarity, replicability, and that findings actually address the questions posed
- **Example ("politeness"):**
  - **Definition:** Use of formal pronouns (*Sie* vs. *du*) and mitigators (*bitte*, *könnten Sie*…) in German requests
  - **Measurement:**
    - Count occurrences of *Sie* vs. *du* in a corpus of service-encounter dialogues
    - Rate politeness markers per utterance (0 = none, 1 = one marker, 2 = multiple markers)

### Tips for working towards and refining a research question

- topic
  - research question 1
    - hypothesis
      - why? (→ literature)
  - research question 2

## Key points

- Research questions are the **"compass"** of empirical studies: they define what data you need, how to collect it, and how to analyse it
- They can emerge from gaps in the literature, existing sites of inquiry (e.g. social events or phenomena), or unexpected findings in your own data
- Unlike precise, testable hypotheses, research questions are broader, exploratory, and open-ended – ideal for qualitative work
- Formulated as Who/What/How/Why/To what extent?, questions may be descriptive (What), explanatory (Why) or evaluative, each suggesting different methods
- Key distinctions:
  - **Primary vs Secondary** (importance/data volume)
  - **Main/Contributory** & **Overarching/Subordinate** (hierarchies)
  - **Empirical/Methodological/Theoretical/Speculative** (focus of inquiry)
  - **Researcher- vs Participant-Generated** (whose concerns drive it)
- Start with many questions, then narrow to those you can fully address within time/resources
- **Operationalizability**: define every term clearly and link each question to specific data and methods
- Each question dictates your:
  - **Data** (e.g. corpus vs interviews)
  - **Collection design** (e.g. experiment vs naturalistic recording)
  - **Transcription conventions** & **analytical framework** (e.g. corpus analysis, discourse analysis)
- In write-ups, document origins, rationale, operationalization, and map questions to methods (tables/diagrams)

# Self-management

## General principles

- Keep it **simple**, both in terms of planning and tools
- Almost any **system** can work, as long as it's a system and you use it consistently

## Setting SMART goals

![SMART goals](att/smart-goals.png){width="600"}

## Managing TODOs

- Include all your TODOs (from other projects, private commitments)
- Set TODOs the right way:
  - **Actionable**
  - Have a **date** (scheduled start & deadline)
- Make a **plan** (weekly & daily time slots)
- **Review** your days, weeks, months, year

## Prioritising tasks

### Marbles in a jar

### Pareto's law

![Pareto's law](att/paretos-law.png){width="600"}

- 20% of actions can give 80% of results
- The remaining 20% of results will require 80% of the time

### Eisenhower matrix

![Eisenhower matrix](att/eisenhower-matrix.png){width="600"}

## Task management tools

- Pen and paper
- Digital tools, e.g., [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) or [TickTick](https://ticktick.com/)
- Note-taking apps like Logseq/Obsidian

## Frameworks for productivity

- [Getting Things Done (GTD)](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) by David Allen
- [Zen to Done (ZTD)](https://zenhabits.net/zen-to-done-ztd-the-ultimate-simple-productivity-system/) by Leo Babauta (a simpler version of GTD)

## Making a time plan

- Start with the **end** in mind: work backwards from the deadline
- Use **buffers**: everything takes longer than we think
- Tools:
  - Calendar
  - Gantt charts
    - ![Gantt chart](att/gantt-chart.png){width="600"}

# Exercises

## Taking notes with Obsidian

1. Install Obsidian from [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/)
2. Create a new "vault"
3. Start drafting your research questions:
  - Use Markdown formatting
  - Create links to related concepts (e.g. `[[sociolinguistics]]`, `[[COCA]]`)
  - Check the graph view for connections between concepts
4. Export your notes as PDF for submission

## Self-management

### Setting goals

Set a SMART goal

### Prioritise

Prioritise your tasks for the next 7 days:

- 80/20 Pareto rule
- Eisenhower matrix

### Manage your time

Make a specific time plan (for your research project)

#### Tools

- Digital calendar
- [TeamGantt](https://www.teamgantt.com/) or similar

#### Project agenda

1. Determine topic, research questions, hypotheses
2. Find and read previous literature
3. Collect and pre-process data
4. Conduct analysis, gather results
5. Write the paper
6. Revise your paper
