# Course description

This course will guide you through the process of designing and conducting a research project in linguistics, from identifying a topic, to carrying out the research, to composing the final written document (e.g., term paper, BA thesis, Zulassungsarbeit).

You will be offered practical advice on

- planning and organising your work,
- identifying and narrowing a topic,
- developing and refining research questions,
- finding and managing background information and literature,
- effective and sustainable note-taking,
- referencing literature and avoiding plagiarism,
- collecting and analysing data using various methods (e.g. corpora, surveys),
- reporting results and academic writing.

For each topic, I will provide relevant materials and guide you through hands-on exercises to develop practical skills. You will have the opportunity to share your project ideas and receive constructive feedback.
