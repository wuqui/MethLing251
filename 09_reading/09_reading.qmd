# Reading

## What to read?

::: {.notes}
12:20–12:25 (5m)
:::

- **Start general**: Begin with introductions for a broader picture.
- **Narrow down**: Focus on specific articles and theoretical concepts.
- **Refine keywords**: Gradually build a keyword list for the research area.
- **Skim for relevance**: If unsure, read the abstract, ToC, or index for keywords.
- **Include recent work**: Make sure to cover the latest publications on your topic.
- **Reach saturation**: Your reading is likely complete when you see the same sources repeatedly.

### Modes of reading

- **Scanning**: Quick reading, looking for key words.
- **Skimming**: Cross-reading the whole text to identify key passages.
- **Selective reading**: Reading only passages relevant to your topic.
- **Close reading**: Careful, critical reading of the full text, often involving notes.
- **Creative reading**: Reading with an open mind for inspiration.

**Recite**: also **relate** the information to relevant concepts related to your topic.

## Reading & writing

::: {.notes}
12:40–12:45 (5m)
:::

- **Linked processes**: Reading with a topic in mind is always tightly linked to writing.
- **Produce excerpts**: For core texts, process the information in your own words rather than just rewriting.

___

::: {.small}

## First reading

- **Get an overview**: Gain a general picture and outline of the text.
- **Note the structure**: Write down headings, chapters, and sections.
- **Indicate irrelevant parts**: Mark sections that are not useful for your work.

## Second reading

- **Identify topics**: Note the topic of each chapter, section, and paragraph.
- **Summarise**: Write a summary for each part of the text.
- **Note sources**: Keep track of important authors for further reading.
- **Record quotes**: Write down possible quotations with page numbers.
- **Find examples**: Note helpful examples, tables, and figures.
- **Link to your work**: Summarise relevant aspects and connect them to your research questions.
- **Add personal notes**: Make notes about questions, unclear points, or links to other texts.

## Highlighting and marking

::: {.notes}
12:45–12:50 (5m)
:::

- **Work on the text**: Use a PDF or photocopy to highlight and mark information directly.
- **Use colours**: Employ a colour-coding system to work out the text's structure.
- **Highlight key info**: Mark names, definitions, examples, and quotes in different ways.
- **Comment in margins**: Add keywords, paraphrases, and summaries on the sides.
- **Cross out irrelevant parts**: Strike through passages that are not important for your work.
- **Use post-its**: Add notes for cross-references, your own ideas, or problematic passages.
- **Leverage tools**: This works very well with Zotero's built-in PDF reader.

___

## Visualisations

## Strategies for difficult passages

::: {.notes}
12:52–13:00 (8m)
cf. @Cottrell2013StudySkills, pp. 168f.
:::

If you have the feeling that you don't understand what you're reading or that you cannot make sense of it, check the following issues:

1.  Make sure you have the necessary **theoretical background** for the text – if not, go back to a more general, introductory text.
2.  Try to briefly **sum up** what you have read after a few sentences.
3.  Try to read with a **specific question** in mind in order to get an answer from the text. If (2) or (3) do not work, re-read the passage, read it aloud.
4.  **Highlight** and colour-code relevant notions (see section on highlighting).
5.  Ask questions:
    -   What does the author want to show?
    -   Is there a particular question behind this passage?
    -   Why is the passage relevant? Is it relevant for my topic?
    -   What do I learn from this?

## Critical evaluation

::: {.notes}
13:00–13:10 (10m)
Break: 13:00–13:05
cf. @Cottrell2013StudySkills, pp. 187–196
:::

- **Evaluate reasoning**: Is the information relevant, logical, and not circular?
- **Check structure**: Does the text have a logical flow?
- **Verify explanations**: Are aspects explained before they are applied?
- **Assess evidence**: Is there appropriate and reliable evidence to support claims? Are any issues missing?
- **Analyse conclusions**: Do the conclusions make sense? Are they well-supported by the evidence?
