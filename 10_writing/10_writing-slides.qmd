- **Topic**: Applying reading strategies to a research article in a collaborative setting.
- **Objective**: To analyse an academic text from multiple perspectives and share findings.
- **Task**: We will use a jigsaw method with group work.
    - **Step 1: Expert Groups (15 mins)**
        - **Group 1**: Answer the 'Skimming and Scanning Questions'.
        - **Group 2**: Answer the 'Comprehension Questions'.
        - **Group 3**: Answer the 'Critical Thinking Questions'.
    - **Step 2: Jigsaw Groups (10 mins)**
        - New groups will be formed with experts from each topic.
        - Each expert presents their group's findings to their new jigsaw group.
    - **Step 3: Class Discussion (5 mins)**
        - We will reconvene as a full class to discuss key takeaways.


## Skimming and Scanning Questions

::: {.notes}
12:16–12:31 (Expert Group 1)

**Answers**:

1. 307 tweets contain AAVE features (1.9% of the 15,804 total tweets)
2. User 4, with 6.8% of his tweets containing at least one AAVE feature
3. *Y'all*, *Yaas*, *Basic*, and *Thirsty* (most common lexical AAVE features)
4. Two reasons for selecting White southern British users:
    - To maximize distance between AAVE and user's habitual dialect (Southern British English)
    - Well-established use of stylized AAVE features in gay community subcultures
5. 15,804 tweets total analyzed
6. Orthographic representation of (ING) as *in* for *ing* (highest frequency phonological feature)
7. 60.9% of tweets containing AAVE features were directed at other users
:::

1. How many tweets in the study contain AAVE features?
2. Which user had the highest frequency of AAVE feature usage and what was the percentage?
3. What are the four most common lexical AAVE features found in the tweets?
4. Identify two reasons why White southern British users were selected for the study.
5. What is the total number of tweets analysed in the study?
6. Which phonological feature of AAVE had the highest frequency in the dataset?
7. What percentage of tweets containing AAVE features were directed at other users?

___

## Comprehension Questions

::: {.notes}
12:16–12:31 (Expert Group 2)

**Answers**:

1. The study explores how orthographic variations of AAVE on Twitter are used to deploy personae, specifically examining the "Sassy Queen" persona among gay British men
2. Ilbury extracts 15,804 tweets from 10 gay British men using Twitter's API, then manually codes tweets for AAVE features and analyzes their context
3. Three types of AAVE features with examples:
    - Lexical features: *Y'all haters corny*
    - Phonological features: *Feeling pumped for another night in the big city working dat podium!*
    - Morphosyntactic features: *Filters be a gay's best friend*
:::

1. What is the primary research question of the study?
2. What methodology does Ilbury use to collect and analyse data?
3. List three features of AAVE identified in the tweets and provide examples from the study.

___

## Critical Thinking Questions

::: {.notes}
12:16–12:31 (Expert Group 3)

**Answers**:

1. Consider cultural appropriation issues and reinforcement of stereotypes. The use of AAVE features by non-AAVE speakers can appropriate Black cultural expressions and potentially reinforce harmful stereotypes about Black women through the "Sassy Queen" persona
2. Strengths: Detailed qualitative analysis of digital data, innovative focus on stylistic variation in social media. Limitations: Small sample size (10 users), potential biases in manual coding, limited to specific demographic and platform
:::

1. Discuss the ethical implications of using AAVE features by non-AAVE speakers on social media.
2. Evaluate the strengths and limitations of the methodology used in this study.

## Practice: Improving Academic Style

**Task**: Identify problems and suggest improvements for these sentences.

1. *The implementation of the methodology for the investigation of linguistic variation in the aforementioned community was undertaken by the researchers in order to facilitate the acquisition of data pertaining to phonological variables.*

2. *It can be argued that there exists a possibility that the results which were obtained might perhaps suggest that certain tendencies in language use are observed to be present in the data.*

3. *The analysis of the corpus data was performed and the findings were identified and the patterns were discovered and then the conclusions were drawn.*

4. *Participants evidenced manifestations of linguistic accommodative behaviours in conversational contexts characterised by interactional asymmetries.*

::: {.notes}
13:22–13:24

1. rewrite using active voice and fewer nominalisations, e.g. "We investigated linguistic variation in the community and collected phonological data."
2. remove hedging, e.g. "The results suggest that certain linguistic tendencies are present in the data."
3. use parallel structure, e.g. "We analysed the corpus data, identified key patterns, and drew conclusions."
4. simplify with clear verbs, e.g. "Participants used accommodation behaviours in asymmetric conversational contexts."
